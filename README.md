# Web-Scraping-Ebay
This project has been realised just for practicing some Web Scraping techniques using Beautiful Soup library. In this case I was interested to find all the Dr.Martens boots size 43 on Ebay kleinanzeigen and create a csv file with all the item listed, with the date, the price and the description of them, in order to have a personal database of that.

This code could be easily customized to scrape different items in Ebay Kleinanzeigen, but potentially it would be easily adaptable for other marketplaces online, you just need to change the URL in the first lines. The idea and the code used for the web scraping can also be utilised for other kind of website and data, this is meant to be just an example of how web scraping can be used to create a personal database.
